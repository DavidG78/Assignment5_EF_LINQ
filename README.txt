Create a new console application that connects to the Contact database you created in Assignment 4 (AKA Lab 4). Create an Entity Framework data model and use it to retrieve all the contacts from the database and write them out to the console.

CHALLENGE: Reproduce ALL of the CRUD operations you created in Assignment 4 but this time using only Entity Framework. and expose those operations to the user with the same menu system



Notes: My solution works but I don't feel as if I've created and reused code properly in the CRUD functions. I think there is more I can do to simplify the program.
